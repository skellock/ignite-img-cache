# ignite-img-cache

Adds [react-native-img-cache](https://github.com/wcandillon/react-native-img-cache) to your project which is using [ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite).

## Requirements

`react-native-img-cache` requires `react-native-fetch-blob` but due the extra step of linking you'll need to install it as well.

```sh
ignite add fetch-blob
```

then 

```sh
ignite add img-cache
```

## Notes

I would have preferred to call this `ignite-image-cache`, but the underlying library is called `ignite-img-cache`.  It's all good.  (__eye twitch__).
